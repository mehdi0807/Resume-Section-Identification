# Resume-Section-Identification
The presented Github repository offers a comprehensive solution to the challenge posed by ZSoft (an IT consulting firm working on an automatic hiring system named “Hiring Master”) in the Haick 2023 Datathon, which was hosted by `School of AI Algiers`.<br>
The primary objective of the task was to predict the purchasing behavior of Jumia's customer base for the next four months, using a dataset that only covered three months' worth of information in the test set.<br><br><br>
My approach to fine-tuning the Camembert model for resume section classification involved several key steps. First, I carefully preprocessed the resume dataset, performing text tokenization and handling any data anomalies to ensure the model's input was clean and consistent. Then, I employed transfer learning techniques, leveraging the pre-trained Camembert model from Hugging Face as a starting point. <br><br>
In fact, I participated in the challenge with my team 'DATA SQUAD' and we secured first place with an accuracy of `82.91%` on the public leaderboard and an accuracy of `82.65%` on the private leaderboard.<br>

After the datathon ended, I endeavored to improve upon these results and organized the updated solution in the Jupyter notebook presented in this repository. The updated results show an accuracy of `83.14%` on the public leaderboard and an accuracy of `83.36%` on the private one.<br>
